You solved that last one really quickly! Have you ever tried to reverse engineer a compiled x86 binary? Let's see if you are still as quick.

39 bytes -- 26 are flag, 13 are flare-on
12345678901234567890123456@flare-on.com

R_y0u_H0t_3n0ugH_t0_1gn1t3@flare-on.com


Goes in reverse order, XOR by start (0x04), then chain XOR. Saw this before, but only the end result, not the encoder.
